When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need

# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone. The following guidelines will help you understand our expectations and streamline the review process.

## Code Style

We follow the LLVM coding style for all C/C++ code. Please ensure your code conforms to this style. To automate this process, we use `clang-format`:

```sh
clang-format -i path/to/your/file.cpp
```

It is recommended to install the [Clang-Format extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) in Visual Studio Code to format your code automatically.

## Commit Messages

Please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. These hooks will check your code for proper formatting before allowing a commit.

### Setting up pre-commit hooks for the first time

1. Install the pre-commit package, for example, in Ubuntu you can run:
    ```sh
    sudo apt install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
    pre-commit install
    ```

3. Manually run the hooks on all files (optional but recommended for first-time setup):
    ```sh
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

4. Auto Format when you commit:
    ```sh
    export AUTO_FORMAT=1
    ```

5. Install cppcheck:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install cppcheck
    ```

6. Disable cppcheck:
    ```sh
    export DISABLE_CPPCHECK=1
    ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure your code follows the style guide and passes all tests.
2. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
3. Push your changes to your fork:
    ```sh
    git push origin your-branch
    ```
4. Create a pull request against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

In your pull request, please include:
- A descriptive title and detailed description of the changes.
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests.
